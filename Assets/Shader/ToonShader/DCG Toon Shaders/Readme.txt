Thanks for bought my asset :) !

Well the use of this shader is pretty straight forward, all the shaders come with normal map, occlusion map and outline settings.

Basically you need to put all your textures in the corresponding inputs, the same as a normal material, but in this case they will have an stylized and polish toon looking appearance.

The custom lighting shader works with a ramp texture(size does not matter) from left to right. left being 0, and right being 1, in another words, shadows are in the left and highlights on the right, so now you have a pretty nice idea how to make your own ramp :), can't wait to see them!
